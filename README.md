# Restless Toolkit

This project consists of custom controls and utility classes that may be used in a Wpf application.
It is an offshoot of the [Restless Tools](https://github.com/victor-david/restless-tools) project, which
is no longer under active development. Going forward, **Restless Toolkit** will provide some of the same
controls, improved ones, while removing obsolete functionality, and combining other functionality into a single package.
